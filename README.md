# Cucumber-with-Selenium_Behaviour-Driven-Development-Tutorial
**Behavior-driven development is a software development process that is derived from Test-Driven Development (TDD) concept.**


BDD focuses on:
*	Where to start in the process
*	What to test and what not to test
*	How much to test in one go
*	What to call the tests
*	How to understand why a test fails


Principles of BDD
Test-driven development is a software development methodology which essentially states that for each unit of software, a software developer must:
*	define a test set for the unit first;
*	make the tests fail;
*	then implement the unit;
*	finally verify that the implementation of the unit makes the tests succeed.
