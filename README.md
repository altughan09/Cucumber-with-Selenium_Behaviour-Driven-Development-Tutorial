# Cucumber-with-Selenium_Behaviour-Driven-Development-Tutorial
**Behavior-driven development is a software development process that is derived from Test-Driven Development (TDD) concept.**


BDD simply focuses on:
*	**Where** to start in the process
*	**What** to test and what not to test
*	**How much** to test in one go
*	**What** to call the tests
*	**How** to understand why a test fails

In this tutorial I have implemented in my project a BDD tool known as **Cucumber** to test the following two scenarios;

* Check login & logout functionality on demo website available at http://demo.guru99.com/V4/
* Check the reset functionality of the login form

To execute these Cucumber test scenarios, I created **Features** and **Step Definition** files.

Cucumber tool is based on the Behavior Driven Development process that bridges the gap between non-developers and developers. As it uses a plain text format called **Gherkin** it makes the code understandable for non-developers (for example for clients). 

To make the testing phase even easier I also took advantage of **Selenium Framework** that is a browser automation tool. Before starting out with the project the following libraries must be referenced inside the project file. 

**Selenium jar files:** (Downloaded from Selenium Official Website)
* Selenium-server-standalone

**Cucumber jar files** (Downloaded from Maven Repository)
* Cucumber-core
* Cucumber-html
* cobertura code coverage
* Cucumber-java
* Cucumber-junit
* Cucumber-jvm-deps
* Cucumber-reporting
* Hemcrest-core
* Gherkin
* Junit
