# Cucumber-with-Selenium_Behaviour-Driven-Development-Tutorial
**Behavior-driven development is a software development process that is derived from Test-Driven Development (TDD) concept.**


BDD simply focuses on:
*	**Where** to start in the process
*	**What** to test and what not to test
*	**How much** to test in one go
*	**What** to call the tests
*	**How** to understand why a test fails

In this tutorial I have implemented in my project a BDD tool known as **Cucumber**. To make the testing phase easier I also took advantages of **Selenium Framework** for automating Chrome browser.
